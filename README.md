# dataiddumper-1.20.1
Data Id Dumper is a utility mod for Minecraft that automatically generates comprehensive lists of registered data identifiers into text files upon server startup. These identifiers include items, blocks, entities, biomes, structures, enchantments, recipes, fluids, attributes, stats, block entities, particles, potions, dimensions, damage types, loot pool entries, and villager professions. Organized neatly into categorized files within a designated folder, these lists provide modpack creators and datapack developers with quick access to essential data ids without the need for in-game searching. Simplify your Minecraft experience with Data Id Dumper, the ultimate tool for managing and integrating game data into custom creations.

[upon server startup a folder named "data_dump" will be created in the modpack folder where this mod installed in, there you can find all the dumped id data]
